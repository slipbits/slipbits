Hi;

Interests in almost anything. Right now I'm looking at Cryptocurrencies - just as an interest - and am 
looking to implement SHA3. I have the FIPS 202 publication, and will be reading it soon and implementing 
a version of it. The goal is to get at least 2 orders of magnitude increase in speed over a 'normal' 
function-centric approach. At one point in the remote past I did a similar effort for DES, FIPS Pub 46.
I never checked it out but I suspect that there was at least a 2 order of magnitude increase in speed.

When time permits I'll probably get into some AI, just to see what it's like.

Right now I'm finishing a project in evaluating financial documents for my Home Owners Association. The
association is a condominiums (legal term) in which common areas are managed by a board of directors. 
In my case, they have done a woeful job and so, I thought, might as well see where the moneys gone.

Interests, efforts, etc. are located on my website, https://slipbits.com/. Take a look and please comment
on the goods, the bads, and the indifferent.
